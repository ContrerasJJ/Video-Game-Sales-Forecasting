Data Analysis • A/B Testing • Market Insights • Python • Pandas • Seaborn • Statistical Testing

🔍 Project Summary
This project analyzes global video game sales (2013–2016) to forecast trends for 2017 and help a gaming company make data-driven marketing decisions.
The analysis explores:
Platform performance
Genre preferences across regions
ESRB rating impact
Review score influence
Sales lifecycle patterns
Hypothesis testing to compare ratings
Your work identifies what types of games succeed in each region and which platforms/genres should be prioritized for 2017.

🎯 Objectives
Analyze sales distribution by region (NA, EU, JP)
Identify top-performing genres and platforms
Evaluate ESRB rating impact on sales
Determine how critic/user reviews influence performance
Test hypotheses comparing platform and genre ratings
Recommend strategy for the 2017 gaming market

🛠 Tools & Skills Used
Python
Pandas & NumPy
Seaborn & Matplotlib
SciPy (Welch’s t-test)
EDA & Data Cleaning
Statistical Analysis
Data Visualization

📊 Key Insights
⭐ Regional Differences in Genre Popularity
North America & Europe: Action, Shooter, and Sports dominate
Japan: Role-Playing leads significantly
⭐ Platform Trends
NA: PS4, XOne, X360 lead
EU: PS4 strongest, followed by PS3 & XOne
Japan: 3DS far ahead, followed by PS3 and PSV
⭐ Sales Lifecycle
Platforms show a common pattern:
Introduction: Low early sales
Growth: Rapid rise in sales
Peak: Highest annual sales
Decline: Sharp drop as new consoles release
⭐ ESRB Ratings
M-rated games dominate sales in NA and EU
Japan largely prefers “Unrated” or T-rated titles
⭐ Review Scores
Critic reviews show a stronger correlation with sales than user reviews
High critic score → higher likelihood of commercial success

🧪 Statistical Hypothesis Tests
A. Xbox One vs. PC Ratings
H₀: Average ratings are equal
H₁: Ratings differ
Test: Welch’s t-test
p-value ≈ 0.1476 → Fail to reject H₀
➡️ No evidence of rating differences between platforms.
B. Action vs. Sports Ratings
H₀: Ratings are equal
H₁: Ratings differ
Test: Welch’s t-test
Result: Both sample sizes = 0 (insufficient data)
➡️ No testable difference due to missing ratings.

📈 2017 Forecasting Approach
To forecast 2017 sales, you selected 2013–2016 as the relevant training period because:
It captures the most recent gaming generation
Older consoles (PS2, Wii, DS) had already declined
It best reflects current console trends entering 2017

💼 Business Recommendations
North America: Prioritize Action & Shooter games on PS4 and Xbox One
Europe: Focus on Action, Shooter, and Sports titles for PS4
Japan: Invest heavily in Role-Playing games and 3DS platform titles
Develop games with strong critic appeal
Reduce investment in older declining platforms
Align marketing by region-specific genre preferences

🙌 Conclusion
This project demonstrates your ability to:
Process and analyze large datasets
Build clear visualizations of market trends
Model platform and genre performance
Perform statistical hypothesis tests
Translate analysis into business recommendations
Forecast using logically selected historical windows
It reflects real-world skills valuable in data analyst and data scientist roles.
